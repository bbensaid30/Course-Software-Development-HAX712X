# Workflows

This part is not complete but for now, it gives some notions of a workflow.

## What is a workflow ?
The different collaborators can have different git using habits. A workflow is a set of recommandations to follow in order to use Git efficiently. In other words, it is a set of guidelines for all the collaborators. 

A basic worflow is the **Feature Branch Workflow**: a branch is created for each functionality and once implemented, it is merged with the main branch. GitFlow is an extension of this workflow. 

## GitFlow

### What is Gitflow ?

GitFlow is based on the Feature Branch Workflow (one branch=one functionality/feature) but it adds:

- a branch called **develop** which integrates the feature branches
- different **release** branches that gather a set of features that are considered as finished
- **main branch** that contains only code coming from **release** branches
- **hotfix** branches to solve bugs coming from the **main branch**

### Gitflow commands

There is a GitFlow plug-in to make easier the use of  this workflow:

- ```git flow init``` initiates the project, create the main branch and the branch **develop**
- ```git flow feature start namefeature``` creates a new branch from the branch develop.
- ```git flow feature finish namefeature``` merges the feature branch with the develop one. 
- ```git flow release start 0.0.1``` creates the release and ```git flow release finish 0.0.1```Â integrates the feature to the main branch.
