# General instructions

For this course, the grading consists of long-term project.

You will need to work all along the semester to master it. Please start to work on it as soon as possible. You need to use your GitHub account (see [Git lecture](../../Courses/Git/Basis_PartII.qmd)) as the expected outputs for this course are GitHub repositories.


# Team project: bikes and bike-sharing in Montpellier

The project consists of an investigation of bike traffic in Montpellier, through the analysis of the following datasets (at least):

- Bike-sharing rides: [Courses des vélos VéloMagg de Montpellier Méditerranée Métropole](https://data.montpellier3m.fr/dataset/courses-des-velos-velomagg-de-montpellier-mediterranee-metropole)


- Cyclist and pedestrian counting: [Comptages vélo et piéton issus des compteurs de vélo](https://data.montpellier3m.fr/dataset/comptages-velo-et-pieton-issus-des-compteurs-de-velo
)
- Open street map data: [Open Street Map](https://www.openstreetmap.org/)



It will be mostly a visualization project, hopefully an interactive one, with the creation of a website (as for the personal project), helping to navigate your work. The study could focus at least on the following time resolution: last month, last year and all years.
Among the output expected is

1. a video such as this one [NYC CitiBike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKJ6BsycvJA):

</div>
1. an interactive map of Montpellier predicting the traffic of bikes in the city for the next day, say à la Bison futé, with a color code for the traffic intensity:
